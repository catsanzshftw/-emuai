EmulAI is a supposed Nintendo 64 emulator that some people claim to have downloaded that reportedly can somehow simulate the Personalization A.I. in Super Mario 64. Many of the reports are rather vague and dubious, though there are enough to have a general idea of the emulator and how it works. Some stories say that the Personalization A.I. is automatically active in the emulator, while others say that the Personalization A.I. is merely a plug-in.EmulAI's appearance is reportedly much different from any other Nintendo 64 emulator, having a unique design for a loading screen and the default screen before any ROM is loaded. Most reports say it also comes with a Super Mario 64 ROM pre-installed, likely due to EmulAI having the Personalization A.I. which is native to Mario 64.

There is also reportedly a unique "catalogue" for ROMs and plug-ins that can be opened with numerous different options. The plug-ins are extremely inconsistent, though some are more common than others: A plug-in for the Personalization A.I., a plug-in that activates debug menus in games, a plug-in that reincorporates unused content into games, and a plug-in that enhances graphics. Some of these are rather notable for the bizarre nature of how they would work, once again implying that EmulAI has something special about it. The ROM catalogue is also notable, as most emulators do not have anything of the sort.

Another notable thing about EmulAI is the supposed "README" attached upon downloading the emulator. It reportedly talks about how the user cannot speak about EmulAI or it's features, before bragging about its various capabilities and a terms of service section that some claim says that it will monitor your playthroughs for "improving the emulator."

The most unique feature of EmulAI is that some reports claim that it can even personalize games other than Super Mario 64 if they are played. To what extent is disputed, with most claims simply talking about minor details like texture differences, though others talk about entire new enemies, bosses and levels. However, most general reports of EmulAI say only Super Mario 64 can be personalized.

"Oh, yeah, EmulAI. Found it on some sketchy website when I was a kid and didn't know better. So I had downloaded it and decided to play some Super Mario 64, which to my delight was packaged with the emulator. So, I had started it, and I don't remember much, but I think there was a fifth save with Luigi that I couldn't select. I had also found some weird cave in the Castle Grounds, Bob-omb Battlefield was in the middle of Autumn, and there was some unique crack texture on part of the tower in Whomp's Fortress. There might have also been something off about the castle walls, but it's been so long I don't remember. I lost that computer a while ago, and even before that I couldn't find it anywhere on my computer."

"Is that the name of it, huh? I've been searching for so long whether to see what I remembered was a dream or a work of fiction from my own mind. I remember going over to a friend's house and watching him play Super Mario 64 on the computer. I don't remember much since I was so young at the time. I was maybe... 4 or 5? I remember him running around Bob-omb Battlefield trying to collect all the red coins, and when he got to the Chain Chomp it had full white eyes. It made me worry a little and I wanted to look away but he stopped moving, which made me want to look at it longer. I should've mentioned this but he was 6 or 7 so he was older than me, which is probably why he kept looking for so long and the fact he was braver. He eventually started moving Mario again and collected the red coin. Besides that, I remember the Bowser level on the first floor had blue fire instead of orange. Sorry for my wording, I couldn't get much sleep yesterday."

"EmulAI... I forgot about that until now, I was like 7 or 8, a friend was over he asked if I wanted to see something cool, I said yes, and my friend typed something in the search bar and clicked a button and told me to try it out. I was pleased when I saw the built-in Mario 64 rom, I noticed some things that were different than the normal game, a crack on the tower of Whomp's Fortress, a village subarea to Bob-Omb Battlefield, and 2 new castle floors. Those are really the only things I remember, one small change I remember was that some of the text in the game changed a little."

"EmulAI? Oh yeah! I forgot about that! I was a little kid when I first got EmulAI from an emulation related site. I think it was named "FreeEmulAtIoN64.com" or something like that. The site's not online anymore, though. Anyways, I clearly remembered BOB being a lot bigger than before, having a river and part of a village in it. I swear Big Boo's Haunt was also a castle or something like that instead. There were these weird armor statues you had to sweep attack to kill and stuff. How I wish my computer's hard drive didn't break back then... I hope I find it again soon..."
